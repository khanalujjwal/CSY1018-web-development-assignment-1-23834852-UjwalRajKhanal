                        For me, learning the fundamentals of web development—including the coding, design, and
                        debugging
                        processes—was a thrilling experience. This help me to experience a number of ups and downs
                        as a
                        newcomer in this profession, which helped me comprehend the complexities of web development.

                        We were given a project by the university that required us to create a portfolio website. By
                        studying the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. The principles were quite simple to understand,
                        but
                        this ran across more difficult problems. Understanding CSS was one of my main. This took me
                        several
                        tries to completely understand the syntax and how it was used. It felt really great to see
                        the
                        effects after I started using it on my web pages, though. The idea of designing was also new
                        to
                        me.
                        Always loved how websites look and wanted to learn how to design my own. It was challenging
                        to
                        produce a design that was both practical and aesthetically pleasing. This took a lot of
                        trial
                        and
                        error, imagination, and patience.

                        With the assistance of the instructor and other social media channels, everything went
                        swimmingly.I started from scratch and have since learned a modest amount, but I have got
                        some
                        knowledge of the module.


                        One of my close friends assisted me in selecting the colors grey and green. Gray, he says,
                        is a
                        neutral color that may be used to create a sense of balance and stability. It is generally
                        seen
                        as a stable and calm color that can contribute in the formation of a peaceful and harmonious
                        environment.


                        I can now leverage my grasp of computer languages, including how to use github, to create
                        and
                        design websites using my web development skills.I ran into a number of problems while
                        constructing the website, but I was able to work through them. I also learned the value of
                        the
                        frame and a variety of other design-related concepts.
